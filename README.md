# 🌙 Kernel Methods and Classification Visualization Toolkit

This repository provides a collection of **helper functions and visualization tools** for understanding and experimenting with kernel methods, linear classifiers, and synthetic datasets in 2D. The toolkit includes kernel functions (linear, polynomial, Gaussian), synthetic data generators (moons, linear, quadratic), plotting utilities for data and models, and utilities for visualizing classifier decision boundaries.

## 🚀 Features

- 📊 **Kernel Functions**:
  - Linear kernel
  - Polynomial kernel (with adjustable degree)
  - Gaussian (RBF) kernel (with adjustable width)

- 🧪 **Synthetic Data Generators**:
  - Linear binary classification data
  - Quadratic binary classification data
  - Moons dataset (non-linear decision boundaries)

- 🎨 **Visualization Tools**:
  - 2D scatter plots for binary classification data
  - Decision boundary plots for linear and kernel classifiers
  - Digit image plotting utility (`28x28` pixel grayscale images)

- 🔍 **Flexible Classification Model Plots**:
  - Linear classifiers (`plotModel`)
  - Kernelized classifiers (`plotAdjModel`, `plotDualModel`)
  - Parameter visualization (`a`, `b`, `lambda` in dual form)

## 🛠️ How to Use

### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies

Make sure you have the required libraries installed:
            ```bash
            pip install numpy scipy matplotlib

🌱 **Learning Outcomes**

This toolkit helps you:

✅ Understand how different kernels influence decision boundaries
✅ Visualize classifier behavior across different datasets
✅ Explore synthetic data generation for binary classification problems
✅ Develop intuition for how models adapt to non-linear patterns
